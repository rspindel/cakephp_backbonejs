# JavaScript Web applications with CakePHP + Backbone.js or Spine.js

These applications are samples which explained in my blog posts.

## [JavaScript Web application with CakePHP + Backbone.js](http://cx5software.com/blog/2012/03/26/cakephp-backbone-js/ "blog")
This is the first sample application which uses CakePHP + Backbone.js. But I did not use Backbone.js's View concept.
* cakephp_service
* backbone_client

## [JavaScript Web application with CakePHP + Spine.js](http://cx5software.com/blog/2012/03/28/cakephp-spine-js/ "blog")
This is the same application as the first one, but it uses Spine.js instead of Backbone.js.
* cakephp_service
* spine_client

## [CakePHP + Backbone.js with View](http://cx5software.com/blog/2012/04/12/cakephp_backbonejs_with_view/ "blog")
This sample uses Backbone.js's View concept to update views.
* cakephp_service
* backbone_client2

## [CakePHP + Backbone.js without custome parse](http://cx5software.com/blog/2012/04/15/cakephp-backbone-js_jsonformat/ "blog")
This sample removes the custom parse method of Backbone.js's models. 
* cakephp_service_nocustomparse
* backbone_client_nocustomparse
